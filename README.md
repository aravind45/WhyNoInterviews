## 🎯 Why JobMatch AI?

### The Problem with Traditional Resume Reviews

Most tools give you inflated match scores that don't reflect reality. They'll say you're a "95% match" when recruiters disagree.

### Our Solution: Dual Scoring System

- **AI Assessment**: The optimistic view (what you hope for)
- **Skill-Based Score**: The realistic view (what actually matters)

This transparency helps you understand your true chances and focus on winnable opportunities.

### Dual-LLM Analysis

Choose between two AI models for resume analysis:

- **Groq (Llama 3.1)**: Lightning-fast analysis, free tier available, great for quick iterations
- **Claude (Sonnet 4.5)**: Superior analysis quality, better at catching subtle issues, more nuanced recommendations

Users can select their preferred LLM from a dropdown on the analysis page, allowing direct comparison of results.

### Match Score Calculation

```typescript
// Realistic skill-based scoring
matchedSkills = skills found in job description
totalSkills = all skills from resume

if (matchedSkills > 0):
  score = min(95, (matchedSkills / totalSkills) * 100)
else if (no skills match):
  score = min(40, AI_score || 20)  // Fallback capped at 40%
else:
  score = 30  // Default
```

### Verdict Thresholds

- **80%+** = STRONG MATCH ✅
- **60-79%** = MODERATE MATCH ⚠️
- **40-59%** = WEAK MATCH ⚠️
- **20-39%** = LONG SHOT ❌
- **<20%** = NOT A FIT ❌
