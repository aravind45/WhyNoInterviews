## Introduction

The Resume Diagnosis Engine is an AI-powered application that analyzes job seekers' resumes and provides diagnostic insights into why they may not be receiving interview invitations. The system focuses on identifying specific problems, ranking their severity, and providing actionable recommendations rather than building or tracking resumes.
